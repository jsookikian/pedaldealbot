 # Vinyl Deal Bot

 Never miss another vinyl deal again!

I recently wrote a bot which sends notifications to you when your favorite artist or album goes on sale on  [/r/VinylDeals](/r/VinylDeals).

To use it, you just need to comment on one of the top 50 posts on /r/VinylDeals with 

```VinylDealBot [Artist | Album]```

So for example if I commented 

```VinylDealBot Red Hot Chili Peppers```
Or 
```VinylDealBot By The Way```

I would get messages whenever a red hot chili peppers album or By the way is posted on vinyldeals. 

If you want to do multiple artists/albums at a time, just separate them with a semicolon

```VinylDealBot Cream; The Eagles;  Californication```

To remove alerts:

```VinylDealBot Remove Cream; The Eagles;  Californication```

To remove all alerts:

```VinylDealBot RemoveAll```

To show all of the alerts you set up:

```VinylDealBot ShowAlerts```
